                    Your sponsored child has moved to another project and thereby received the new reference number ${object.local_id}. We send you therefore a new label sheet that is valid as of today.

                    We wish you plenty of joy and blessings in the continuing support of your sponsored child.

                    We had some news about ${object.name}, ${object.local_id}, which is that ${he} is no longer in the Compassion program, because ${object.lifecycle_ids[0].translate('request_reason', format)}.
                    <br/>
                    At any given time at Compassion, there are many children just like ${object.firstname}, who are waiting to find a sponsor.  Please take the next two weeks to consider extending your generosity to one of these children.
                    <br/>
                    For a new sponsorship you can use the form attached to this letter or search on our website www.compassion.ch. However, if we do not hear from you by the next two weeks another child will be linked to you and their photo and information will be sent to you.
                    <br/>
                    Thank you so much for reaching out to ${object.firstname} and others like ${him}, you are a real blessing!
